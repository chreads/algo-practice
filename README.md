# Algorithm practice
These are some classic algorithms that took some effort to code up (in Python 3.7), so I'm leaving them here for posterity.
* `SCC.py` finds the strongly-connected components of a directed graph. (Strongly-connected meaning you can get from any vertex in the component to any other vertex in the component.) The only argument is the expected data file, which consists of a text file with one edge of the graph per line, where the first number is the tail node and the second number is the head node, e.g. `1 5` where there is a directed edge from node 1 to node 5.
* `dijkstra.py` finds the shortest paths to each vertex of an undirected graph, given a graph with positive edge lengths. It uses a binary heap (coded up in `node_heap.py`) to achieve this in *O(n* log *m)* running time. The only argument is the expected data file, which is a text file where the first element of each line is the node number, and the successive tab-delimited elements on the same line are CSV pairs of `<node_number>,<edge_length>` of its connected nodes.
