# Algorithm practice
These are some classic algorithms that took some effort to code up, so I'm leaving them here for posterity.
* `SCC.py` finds the strongly-connected components of a directed graph.
* `dijkstra.py` finds the shortest paths to each vertex of an undirected graph, given a graph with positive edge lengths. It uses a binary heap (coded up in `node_heap.py`) to achieve this in *O(n* log *m)* running time.
